## What I Have Done: 
âœ… Install CanCanCan in your project.
âœ… Add a role column to the users table. Remember to use a migration for this.
âœ… A user can delete a post if it is theirs or if they have an admin role (column role has value "admin"). Use CanCanCan for this authorization.
      - For that you need to implement the post deleting functionality. Add the "Delete" button to the view and make sure that only authorized users can see it.
